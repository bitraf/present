get_macaddr.php
---------------
The get_macaddr returns a list with previously connected devices. This script is meant to used with a Netgear Genie WNDR3700v3.
Note that the url, username and password variables are defined in secret.php which is not included here.

index.php and wlan_mac.php
---------
These scripts are unrelated to get_macaddr.php. index.php is used for registering devices to p2k12. wlan_mac.php is used for our IRC bot to get the currently registered and connected devices.
